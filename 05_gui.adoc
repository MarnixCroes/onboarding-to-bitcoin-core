= GUI

TIP: This section has been updated to Bitcoin Core @ https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v23.0[v23.0^]

The GUI has its own separate repo at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui[bitcoin-core/gui^].
PRs which primarily target the GUI should be made here, and then they will get merged into the primary repo.
Developer Marco Falke created https://github.com/MarcoFalke/bitcoin-core/issues/26[an issue^] in his fork which detailed some of the rationale for the split, but essentially it came down to:

. Separate issue and patch management
. More focused review and interests
. Maintain high quality assurance

He also stated that:

Splitting up the GUI (and splitting out modules in general) has been brought up often in recent years. Now that the GUI is primarily connected through interfaces with a bitcoin node, it seems an appropriate time to revive this discussion.
____

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19071[PR#19071^] contained the documentation change now contained in the Bitcoin Core primary repository, along with details of the monotree approach that was ultimately taken.
The documentation change provides guidance on what a "GUI change" is: 

[quote, src/CONTRIBUTING.md]
____
As a rule of thumb, everything that only modifies `src/qt` is a GUI-only pull
request. However:

* For global refactoring or other transversal changes the node repository
  should be used.
* For GUI-related build system changes, the node repository should be used
  because the change needs review by the build systems reviewers.
* Changes in `src/interfaces` need to go to the node repository because they
  might affect other components like the wallet.

For large GUI changes that include build system and interface changes, it is
recommended to first open a PR against the GUI repository. When there
is agreement to proceed with the changes, a PR with the build system
and interfaces changes can be submitted to the node repository.

On a related note, another https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24045[issue^] was recently opened by Falke, to discuss the possibility of instituting the same monotree changes for wallet code.

== Motivation for a GUI

Bitcoin Core has shipped with a GUI since the first version.
Originally this was a wxWidgets GUI, but in 2011 a move to QT was https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/521[completed].
Satoshi originally had plans to have a decentralized market place and even poker game inside Bitcoin, so including a GUI, which also had wallet and address book functionality, made sense from the get-go.

The motivation to _continue_ to include a GUI with Bitcoin Core today is for accessibility.
New users can access a best-in-class Bitcoin experience via a single software package.
It's not safe or realistic to expect users to download multiple programs and connect them securely into a software suite, just to use bitcoin.

It does not have to be the prettiest UI, but needs to provide the functionality to use bitcoin.
It is possible to connect other frontends to Bitcoin Core, but they are connected via RPCs, and do not have the first-class interface (to the node component) that the bundled GUI has.

== Building the GUI

`bitcoin-qt`, which includes the QT GUI with the node, is built automatically when the build dependencies are met.
Required packages to meet dependencies can be found in the build instructions in _src/doc/build-*.md_ as appropriate for your platform.
If you have the required packages installed but do not wish to build the `bitcoin-qt` then you must run `./configure` with the option `--with-gui=no`.

[NOTE]
====
If the build is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` then additional binaries will be built:

. `bitcoin-node`
. `bitcoin-wallet`
. `bitcoin-gui`
====

== Qt

QT is currently very intertwined with the rest of the codebase.
See the library <<library-dependency-graph,depencency graph>> for more context.

Developers would ideally like to reduce these dependencies in the future.

== Qt documentation

There is useful documentation for developers looking to contribute to the Qt side of the codebase found at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki//Developer-Notes-for-Qt-Code[Developer Notes for Qt Code^].

== Main GUI program

The loading point for the GUI is _src/qt/main.cpp_.
`main()` calls `GuiMain()` from _src/qt/bitcoin.cpp_, passing along any program arguments with it.
`GuiMain` starts by calling `SetupEnvironment()` which amongst other things, configures the runtime locale and charset.

Next an empty `NodeContext` is set up, which is then populated into a fully-fledged node interface via being passed to `interfaces::MakeNode()`, which returns an `interfaces::Node`.
Recall that in <<Wallet component initialisation>> we also saw the wallet utilizing a `NodeContext` as part of its `WalletInitInterface`.
In both cases the `NodeContext` is being used to pass chain and network references around without needing to create globals.

After some QT setup, command-line and application arguments are parsed.
What follows can be outlined from the code comments:

[start=3]
. Application identification
. Initialization of translations, so that intro dialogue is in user's language
. Now that settings and translations are available, ask user for data directory
. Determine availability of data directory and parse bitcoin.conf
. Determine network (and switch to network specific options)
. URI IPC sending
. Main GUI initialization

== GUI initialisation

After configuration the GUI is initialized.
Here the `Node` object created earlier is passed to `app.SetNode()` before a window is created and the application executed.

The bulk of the Qt GUI classes are defined in _src/qt/bitcoingui.{h|cpp}_.

== QML GUI

Since writing this documentation focus has been directed towards re-writing the Qt code leveraging the https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html[Qt QML^] framework.
This will allow developers to create visually-superior, and easier to write and reason-about GUI code, whilst also lowering the barriers to entry for potential new developers who want to be able to focus on GUI code.

The recommendation therefore is to familiarise yourself with Qt QML and review the current codebase for the latest developments.
You can follow along with the latest QML work in the specific https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml/blob/main/src/qml/README.md[bitcoin-core/qml-gui^] repo.

== Bitcoin design

The https://bitcoin.design/guide/[Bitcoin design guide^] provides some guidance on common pitfalls that Bitcoin GUI designers should look out for when designing apps (like `bitcoin-qt`).

== Testing QT

Currently, although several QT tests exist in _src/qt/test_, there is no good way to test QT changes except by hand.
A good way to try and have QT code included in the test framework is to target having the RPC layer be a thin as possible, so more code can be re-used between RPC and GUI.
