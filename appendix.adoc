== PIMPL technique

:pimpl_addrman_review: https://bitcoincore.reviews/22950

The Bitcoin Core codebase contains many classes of the form `class *Impl`.
These classes are taking advantage of the Pointer to Implementation https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl[technique^] which helps to both provide more stable ABIs and also to reduce compile-time dependencies.
